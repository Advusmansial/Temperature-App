<!-- In this example, the login form is created using HTML and the CSS is used to style the form. JavaScript is used to handle the form submission and send a request to the server to check if the email and password are valid.
The fetch() method is used to send a POST request to the server with the email and password as the data payload. The server would then compare the email and password to the one that is stored in a secure location like a database and respond with a JSON indicating success or failure.

It's important to note that this is just an example and this code will not work as is. This example is using the Fetch API to make a request to the server, which is not supported in some older browsers. Also, this example doesn't include the server-side logic and data storage and encryption.

Another important aspect is to always use HTTPS while communicating with the server to encrypt the data in transit, and also use salted hashing algorithm -->
